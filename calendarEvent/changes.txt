Moved files into it's own folder. I took up the whole root. oops.

Changes:
New layout using TableLayout (still incomplete).
Renamed objects for readability, such as strings.
Implemented file writing.
Created and implemented string tokenizer.

Untested:
Calendar.csv is set to be overwritten or appended?
Calendar.csv remains after app is closed?

Coded but not implemented:
File reading
Update existing values
Editing an existing event
